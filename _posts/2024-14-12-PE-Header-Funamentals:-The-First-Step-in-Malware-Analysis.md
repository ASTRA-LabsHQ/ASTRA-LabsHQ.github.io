# PE Header Fundamentals: The First Step in Malware Analysis
This beginner-friendly guide introduces the fundamentals of the Portable Executable (PE) format, focusing on how the PE header and its various sections work. You’ll learn how to analyze these headers, understand imports and exports, detect packing and obfuscation, and leverage tools like Detect It Easy (DIE) to gain valuable insights into Windows executables—laying the foundation for more advanced malware analysis techniques.

## **What is the Portable Executable (PE) Format?**  
  - The format of a file can reveal a lot of information about the functionality of the program. The **Portable Executable (PE)** file format is used by Windows executables, object code, and DLLs. The PE file format is a data structure that contains the information necessary for the Windows OS loader to manage the wrapped executable code. Nearly every file with executable code that is loaded by Windows is in the PE file format. 

  PE Files begin with a header that includes information about the code, the type of application, required library functions, and space requirments. The information that can be found in the PE header is very valuable to a malware analyst. 

  > Running the "file" command on a file can be a quick way to determine what type of file it is you're dealing with.

## **What are PE Headers?**  
  - The PE file format contains a header followed by a series of sections. The header contains metadata about the file itself. Follwoing theheader are the actual sections of the file, each of which contains useful information. 

## **Important Sections of the PE File**
- **.text**: This section contains the instructions that the CPU executes. All other sections store data and supporting information. Generally, this is the only section that can execute and it should be the only section that includes code
- **.rdata**: The .rdata section typically contains the import and export information. This section can also store other read-only data used by the program. Sometimes a file will contain a .idata and a .edata section, which store the import and export information. 
- **.data**: The .data section contains the programs global data. Global data is accessible from anywhere in the program. 
- **.rsrc**: This section includes the resources used by the executable that are not considered part of the executable. This includes things like icons, images, menus, and strings. String can be stored in either the .rsrc section or in the main program, but they are often stored in the .rsrc section formultilanguage support. 

## PE File Sections Table

| Section Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| .text        | Contains the executable code |
| .rdata       | Holds read-only dats that is globally accessible within the program |
| .data        | Stores global data accessed throughout the program  |
| .idata       | Not always present, but stores the import function information |
| .edata       | Not always present, but stores the export function information |
| .pdata       | Present only in 62-bit executables and stores exception-handling information |
| .rsrc        | Stores resources needed by the executable (images, icons, etc.) |
| .reloc       | Contains information for relocation of library files |
