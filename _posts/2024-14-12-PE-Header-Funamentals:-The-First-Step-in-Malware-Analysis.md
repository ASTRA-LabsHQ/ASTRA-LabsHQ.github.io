# PE Header Fundamentals: The First Step in Malware Analysis
This beginner-friendly guide introduces the fundamentals of the Portable Executable (PE) format, focusing on how the PE header and its various sections work. You’ll learn how to analyze these headers, understand imports and exports, detect packing and obfuscation, and leverage tools like Detect It Easy (DIE) to gain valuable insights into Windows executables—laying the foundation for more advanced malware analysis techniques.

## **What is the Portable Executable (PE) Format?**  
  - [Brief summary explaining the concept of a PE file and its significance]

---

## **What are PE Headers?**  
  - [Short description and purpose of headers in a PE file]

## **Common Sections in a PE File**  
  - [Explain the significance of each section]

## PE File Sections Table

| Section Name | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| .text        | [Description] |
| .rdata       | [Description] |
| .data        | [Description] |
| .idata       | [Description] |
| .edata       | [Description] |
| .pdata       | [Description] |
| .rsrc        | [Description] |
| .reloc       | [Description] |

## Imports and Exports of a PE File
- **Imports**  
  - [Explain static, runtime, and dynamic linking; how to view with DIE or Dependency Walker]
- **Exports**  
  - [Explain the concept and importance]
- **Common DLLs and Their Purposes**  
  - Kernel32.dll, Advapi32.dll, User32.dll, Gdi32.dll, Ntdll.dll, Wsock32.dll/Ws2_32.dll, Wininet.dll
- **Function Naming Conventions**  
  - [Discuss functions that include a “W” in their name and what it means]

## **PE header Analysis Workflow**
- Custom flowchart showing the workflow for PE Header Analysis

## Static Analysis of a Malware Sample in Practice
- [Show a sample being analyzed, link to YouTube video timestamp]
- [Example with fewer imports indicating packing or obfuscation]
- [Explain virtual size vs. actual size in sections]

## Packed and Obfuscated Malware
- **Obfuscation**  
  - [Explain why malware authors obfuscate code and how it hinders analysis]
- **Packing**  
  - [Explain what packing is and how it compresses/encodes code]
- **Indicators of Packing**  
  - [Minimal strings, odd section sizes, etc.]
- **Detecting and Unpacking**  
  - [Brief overview of how to identify packers and the basics of unpacking]

## Additional Visual Aids
